# StoreItemDemand

## Purpose
Predict 3 months worth of item sales at different stores. This data comes from the Store Item Demand Kaggle Competition.

## Files
StoreItemDemand.R contains EDA, the methods for feature engineering, and various models that I used for predictions.

## Feature Engineering
Feature engineering came from separating my datetime object into time, day, week, month, and year variables. 

## Methods
I used TBATS, Arima, and Facebook's Prophet package to create prediction models on this data set.
